I am a doctoral scholar in Management Science and Operations at the London Business School. 
My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, reinforcement learning and statistics. 
I apply these techniques in financial economics and portfolio selection. I also consult for quantitative investment management and data analytics organisations.

In my previous life, I was an architect. 
I hold a black belt in full-contact and armoured karate. 
Occasionally, I get lost in an abandoned coal mine or stranded on an island. Oh, and I brew some really good coffee.
